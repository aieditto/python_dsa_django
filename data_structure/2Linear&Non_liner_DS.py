Array:
Array is a linear data structure. Its kind like the list but the biggest difference Is an Array can store only same data type and array sizes are fixed. When declares any array the sizes of array need to declare. 

Disadvantage:
1.	Fixed size (memory waste)
2.	Homogenous (lack of flexibility)

For avoiding homogenous array or normal array I can use referential array.
Referential array is kinda different from normal array because it A Referential Array is an array that stores references to objects or other data structures rather than the actual data itself. In programming, particularly in object-oriented languages like Java, Python, or C#, referential arrays are widely used to hold references to instances of classes or other complex data types. 


Disadvantage:
1.	This are slower than normal array because of when a value is search from the array usually in normal array the value is directly search from the array in linear way by using address. But in Referential Array when any value Is search from the array it first search from the address number then the address pointer the value address which are attach with the value. Then the expected value can be find.

The major issue for static array is fixed size array.
So, the solution is dynamic array. Dynamic array its actually depend on the concept there are doesnâ€™t any special keyword 

Dynamic array is not fixed array. The size is increase as the given input. The biggest similarity is in Python Language List are the Dynamic Array. 

For Example:

List is kind of dynamic array

Code: 
import sys  (system specific)
empty_list=[]

for i in range(0,100):
    print(i,sys.getsizeof(empty_list))
    empty_list.append(i)

0 56
    +32 (add on storage)
1 88 
2 88 
3 88 
4 88 
    +32
